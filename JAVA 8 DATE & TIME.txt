5)Why does immutability matter in the java 8?

A) because no calling code will be able to read them.

B) because my dates are safe by default from modifications by some calling code.

C)because some calling code will not have to dupliate my  dates to modify them.

D) because it allows some calling to modify my dates easily.

Answer---B
old java.util.Date which is not thread safe the new date-time API is immutable and doesnâ€™t have setter methods.


6) What is the eaisest way to concatenate String in java 8?

A) use the +sign, which is thread safe.

B) use the StringBuilder class i.e threadsafe.

C) use the String.join static method that handles
prefix, postfix, and separator

D) use the StringJoiner class that handles prefix, postfix and separator.

Answer----C
you don't need to create another object like StringJoiner. It also allows you to join String from a Collection class like ArrayList or LinkedList, which means you can create a comma-separated String from an ArrayList of String,


7) What is the most efficient way of computing that hashcode of long(primitive type) in java8?

A) the computation should be programmed by hand.

B) the hashcode of a long is the long itself, no need to compute it.

C)wrap the long in a Long to compute the hashcode.

D)use the new static method Long.hashcode.
Answer--- D


11) What does the Map operation do?

A) it takes a stream of a give type, returns a stream of the same type,keeping all the elements.

B) it takes a stream of a give type, returns a stream of the different type,keeping all the elements.
Answer----B

That's why the Stream.map(Function mapper) takes a function as an argument. For example, by using the map() function, you can convert a list of String into a List of Integer by applying the Integer.valueOf() method to each String on the input list.

13)How can i access the javascript PERL in java8?

C)launch the jjs script, located in the same dir as java & javac.



14)What happens when one call two terminal operations on a Stream?

A)an Exception is raised: only one terminal operation is allowed per Stream.

B) the intermediary results are kept, allowing better performance.

C)a corrupt result is returned: more than one terminal operation is not allowed, but not enforced.

D)normal computation is conducted, no intermediary results are kept, performance is no better.

Answer--- A

If we try to call any other terminal function on a closed stream it will result in a java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed.



15)What is LocalTime in java 8?

A) a time with the percision of a minute, with a date.

C) a time with the percision of a second, with no date.

D) a time with the percision of a minute, with no date.
Answer---C,D
LocalTime is an immutable date-time object that represents a time, often viewed as hour-minute-second. Time is represented to nanosecond precision. For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a LocalTime.
